It is possible to now add plants to the list via the button using javascript. Another part that was worked on today was in creating the SVG images that will be used as well as making background images for a possible parallax effect in the index page.

Project now has a parallax intro on the index page. It works well, but I am considering a video background. I need to reserach into what is possible in terms of memmory usage.

Fixed scrolling issue.( the issue was that when the screen was minimized you could see a break in the background continuity.) Fix width issue when scrolling.(The issue was that when you minmized the screen the feldset element would go off center)
